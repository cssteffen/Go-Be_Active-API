<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>Living in Colorado, we have a lot of company between friends and family coming to visit our beautiful state. I am constantly searching for local events and new trails to take them to. However, this resource would be great for those visiting a new location and wanting to explore like a local.</p>
